*Gustavo Fernandez, MS*

## Abstract
**Study Objective:**  
To determine the association between hospital metropolitan status and Medicare charges for Kidney and Urinary Tract Infections (DRG-689) among patients with major complications or comorbidities in New York.

**Data and Methods:**  
We compared mean covered charges for DRG-689 between Metropolitan and Non-Metropolitan hospitals in New York that received Medicare Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS) payments in 2018. Data were extracted from the Inpatient Charge Data FY 2018 and linked with the Rural-Urban Commuting Area (RUCA) dataset from ers.usda.gov.

**Statistical Analysis:**  
We employed Welchâ€™s - Satterthwaite t-test to assess differences in mean charges between metropolitan and non-metropolitan hospitals.

## Results
- **Hospitals:** A total of 102 hospitals in New York reported mean covered charges for DRG-689. Of these, 86.27% were in metropolitan areas and 13.73% in non-metropolitan areas.
- **Mean Charges:** Metropolitan hospitals had mean covered charges of $41,299 (95% CI: $36,815 - $45,783), whereas non-metropolitan hospitals had $19,754 (95% CI: $13,029 - $26,478). This reflects a statistically significant difference of $21,545 (95% CI: $13,683 - $29,407, p < 0.0001).

## Conclusions
Metropolitan status significantly influences hospital charges for DRG-689, with metropolitan hospitals charging substantially higher fees compared to non-metropolitan hospitals. These findings underscore the significant variability in hospital billing practices based on metropolitan status.
